The first step as a web developer, I went through Udemy lectures and understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This project helped me test my ability to apply the knowledge I have learned by using HTML and CSS to develop my first portfolio website. By any means, this site is not perfect but throughout my journey as a full-stack dev. I will update this site and apply future content I have learned.
